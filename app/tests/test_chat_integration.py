"""
WHAT:
    Integration tests for the full /chat pipeline (Phase 7-9 combined)
    with the LLM itself SCRIPTED. Everything else is real: the JWT
    dependency, the orchestration loop, tool execution, the repo layer,
    MongoDB, and the session store.

WHY THE LLM IS MOCKED:
    These tests were never about whether the model is clever - they are
    about whether OUR pipeline threads a request through correctly. Real
    API calls made them nondeterministic and, on the free tier,
    routinely impossible: the suite spends roughly 6,000 of Groq's
    8,000 tokens/minute before reaching the multi-turn test, whose
    second turn alone needs ~5,000 more (full history plus all 34 tool
    schemas, re-sent every round). The test then failed on quota rather
    than on any defect - and a test that fails for reasons unrelated to
    the code stops being read.

    Scripting the model also makes previously UNTESTABLE paths testable,
    because they only occur when a provider misbehaves: rate-limit
    fallback, provider failover, and the tool-iteration ceiling. Those
    are asserted below and never were before.

    A LIE THE MOCK MUST NOT TELL: the tool calls it scripts are executed
    for real, against the real repo layer and the real database. The
    model's CHOICE is faked; the consequences of that choice are not.

    The original live-API tests are kept at the bottom under
    @pytest.mark.live - deselected by default (see pyproject.toml), run
    deliberately with `uv run pytest -m live`. Mocking answers "does our
    code work"; that one answers "does the real model still cooperate",
    and deleting it would quietly drop the only check on the latter.

MECHANISM:
    orchestrator.py does `from app.agent.llm_client import complete`, so
    it holds its OWN reference - patching llm_client.complete would not
    affect it. The patches below therefore target
    app.agent.orchestrator.complete / .get_providers directly.

    Uses httpx.AsyncClient + ASGITransport (NOT Starlette's TestClient):
    this runs every request on the SAME event loop as the test and the
    session-scoped `db` fixture. TestClient runs the app in a separate
    thread with its own loop, which conflicts with the shared Motor
    connection - the real root cause of the "event loop is closed"
    errors seen during Phase 10.

    """Deselected by default (pyproject.toml addopts). Answers the one
    question the mocks cannot: does the REAL model still choose sensible
    tools and produce a usable sentence? Run before a release, or after
    changing the system prompt or tool descriptions.

    EXACTLY ONE TEST LIVES HERE, ON PURPOSE. There were two, and they
    could not both pass: a measured run showed the pair needing ~8,900
    prompt tokens inside the same three seconds, against Groq's free
    limit of 8,000 per minute - so the second failed on quota every
    time, regardless of the code. A suite that fails for reasons
    unrelated to the code stops being read.

    The single-turn test was the one dropped, because this one already
    covers what it checked (the real model picking a real tool and
    writing a real sentence) and adds multi-turn context on top. The
    mocked tests above cover the single-turn pipeline deterministically.
