"""
WHAT:
    Tests for the two searches that run on Zatch's existing Atlas
    indexes - full-text (product_text_index) and vector
    (product_vector_index).

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    These were already built, populated and READY on the cluster; the
    chatbot simply was not using them. So the risk here is not "does
    Atlas work" but "are we querying it correctly" - a $search against
    an unmapped path, or a $vectorSearch against the wrong collection,
    returns EMPTY rather than erroring. Silence is the failure mode, so
    every test below asserts on real results from real data rather than
    on the absence of an exception.

    Live-data tests, not mocked: an index definition is exactly the kind
    of thing a mock would assert into existence while production has it
    wrong.
