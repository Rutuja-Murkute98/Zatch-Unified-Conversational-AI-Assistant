"""
WHAT:
    Tests that the LLM provider chain follows the SENSITIVITY OF THE DATA,
    not a flag and not the ordering of a list.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
    Reading the real `zatch` database means every tool result carries
    somebody's actual order - delivery city, courier tracking number,
    purchase history. Groq and Google's free tiers reserve the right to
    train on what they are sent; Azure OpenAI is contractually excluded.

    It used to be enough that Azure was FIRST in the chain. That is a
    guarantee about ordering, not about destination: one rate limit from
    Azure and the failover handed the same customer data to Groq. A
    safety property that holds only while nothing goes wrong is not a
    safety property, and rate limits are exactly the thing that goes
    wrong - we spent a whole session watching them.

    These tests pin the stronger version: against real data, a
    training-permitted provider is not merely last, it is ABSENT.

FLOW:
    Pure unit tests. get_providers() is lru_cached, so every test clears
    the cache first - otherwise the first test's settings would decide
    every later result.
