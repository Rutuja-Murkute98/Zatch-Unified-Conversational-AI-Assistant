"""
WHAT:
    The ONE place that talks to an LLM. Owns the ordered list of
    providers, the HTTP call itself, and the small set of error types
    the rest of the app reasons about.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    Two providers, one wire format. Groq and Google both expose an
    OpenAI-COMPATIBLE chat-completions endpoint, which means the same
    `messages` list, the same tool schemas, and the same response shape
    work on either - verified against our real 34 schemas before this
    was written. That compatibility is what makes failover safe: the
    conversation history stored by Phase 8 is provider-neutral, so a
    request can switch providers mid-conversation without rewriting
    anything it already said.

    WHY RAW httpx AND NOT AN SDK: the OpenAI-compatible surface we use
    is one POST. A vendor SDK would bring its own exception hierarchy
    per provider, so the orchestrator would have to catch two parallel
    sets of "rate limited" - and the groq SDK in particular hardcodes
    its URL path, so it cannot be pointed at Google at all. One small
    client here means ONE error taxonomy for every provider, and httpx
    was already a dependency.

FLOW:
    orchestrator.py asks get_providers() for the ordered list, then
    calls complete() on each in turn until one answers.

LOGIC:
    WHY THERE IS A FALLBACK AT ALL: Groq's free tier caps at 8,000
    tokens/minute, and one round of our conversation costs ~1,450 of
    them (783 for the tool schemas alone, re-sent every round). That is
    roughly five rounds a minute for the whole app - a single
    multi-turn conversation can exhaust it. Google's free tier is a
    SEPARATE quota at a slightly lower per-round cost (~1,300), so the
    fallback roughly doubles the budget rather than only catching
    outages.

    Order is deliberate: Groq first because it is measurably faster
    (~0.8s vs ~2.1s per call). Google is tried only when Groq will not
    answer, and the app runs on Groq alone when no Google key is set -
    a fallback that is mandatory to boot is not a fallback.

    MODELS ARE PINNED, NOT ALIASED. "gemini-flash-latest" would move
    underneath us silently. That matters more than usual here: the
    model this file originally used (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) vanished
    from the account with a 404, and gemini-2.5-flash was already
    deprecated when we probed it. Two dead model names in one sitting
    is why every call logs the provider and model that served it.

MECHANISM:
    A single shared httpx.AsyncClient (connection pooling, same
    lazy-singleton pattern as app/db/connection.py), and a mapping from
    HTTP status to the three error types below. ASYNC throughout, for
    the same reason Phase 2 chose Motor: a blocking call here would
    freeze every other user's request for the seconds an LLM takes.

    RETURNS THE SAME Completion complete() DOES. That is the whole
    design: the orchestrator's loop is unchanged and cannot tell which
    transport it used, so streaming is a delivery detail rather than a
    second implementation of the conversation. on_text is called with
    each text fragment as it arrives; text also accumulates into the
    returned Completion, so a caller that ignores the callback gets
    exactly the buffered behaviour.

    WHAT STREAMING BUYS, AND WHERE. Only the TEXT turns benefit - a
    round that comes back as tool calls produces nothing a user could
    read. That is fine, because those rounds are where the orchestrator
    emits its own progress events instead: the silence during a lookup
    is filled by saying what is being looked up.

    FAILOVER STOPS AT THE FIRST TOKEN. An HTTP error arrives before any
    body does, so a dead provider still falls through to the next one
    exactly as before. Once bytes have reached the user they cannot be
    recalled, so a mid-stream failure ends the answer rather than
    silently restarting it somewhere else and repeating half a sentence.

    TOOL CALLS ARRIVE IN PIECES. The id and name land in the first
    fragment for an index and the arguments accumulate across many, so
    they are reassembled by index here - a partial arguments string is
    not valid JSON and must never reach the orchestrator's parser.
