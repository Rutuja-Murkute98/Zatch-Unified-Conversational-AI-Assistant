WHAT:
    This file owns the ONE MongoDB connection ("client") the entire app
    will use. It creates that connection once when the app starts, and
    every other file (repositories in Phase 4) will borrow the database
    handle from here instead of creating their own separate connections.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    Opening a new connection for every single database query is slow and
    wasteful — MongoDB connections take real time to establish (network
    handshake, auth, etc.). A single shared, reused connection pool is
    the standard, correct way to talk to a database in a real backend
    that will serve many users/requests concurrently.

FLOW:
    1. App starts up (this will be wired into Phase 9's API startup).
    2. connect_to_mongo() is called once — opens the client, and
       immediately runs a "ping" to confirm the connection actually
       works (fails loudly here if it doesn't, rather than failing
       later on a random user's first query).
    3. Every repository function (Phase 4) calls get_database() to get
       the same shared database handle.
    4. On shutdown, close_mongo_connection() cleanly releases the
       connection.

LOGIC:
    We use `motor`, the ASYNC MongoDB driver, not the plain `pymongo` we
    used a moment ago just for the manual read-only test. Motor is what
    the real app needs, because a chatbot serving many users at once
    must not let one slow database query freeze every other user's
    conversation — async allows the app to handle other requests while
    waiting on a query.

MECHANISM:
    - AsyncIOMotorClient is Motor's connection pool object — created
      once, reused everywhere.
    - We read the database name from settings rather than hardcoding
      "zatch," so this stays correct even when we eventually swap to the
      production connection string (Phase 2, Step H of the replication
      plan) which might use a different configured default database name.
    - A module-level variable (_client) holds the single shared instance;
      get_database() raises a clear error if someone calls it before
      connect_to_mongo() has run, instead of silently returning nothing.
