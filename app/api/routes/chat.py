"""
WHAT:
    The two ways to hold a conversation. /chat returns the finished
    reply in one JSON response; /chat/stream sends the same reply as it
    is produced, over Server-Sent Events.

WHY BOTH:
    /chat is the contract Phase 12's mobile app was written against, and
    a streaming endpoint is a different shape of client code. Changing
    it would mean the integration has to land at the same moment as this
    does. So /chat is untouched and /chat/stream is added beside it -
    the mobile app adopts streaming when it is ready to, not when we
    are.

    They are NOT two implementations. Both call the same
    run_conversation; the only difference is that the streaming one
    passes a callback. There is no second orchestration loop to keep in
    step, which is the failure mode this shape exists to avoid.

WHY STREAMING AT ALL:
    A measured answer takes 8-10 seconds, and the handover notes advise
    talking over the silence. Most of that is spent on tool rounds that
    produce no readable text, so streaming TOKENS alone would not fill
    it - the first token cannot arrive until the lookups are done. What
    fills it is the status events: the assistant says what it is looking
    up while it looks it up, and then types the answer out.

MECHANISM:
    run_conversation runs as a task and pushes events into a queue; the
    response generator drains that queue into SSE frames. A queue rather
    than yielding directly because the callback is called from deep
    inside the loop, which knows nothing about HTTP.

              catalogue search, WITH an image url. Only fires for

    done CARRIES THE WHOLE REPLY, not just a terminator. A client can
    render the tokens as they arrive and then replace what it drew with
    the authoritative text - which is what makes the fallback paths work
    unchanged. When the model never produced a token (a rate limit, a
    dead provider), those replies are still real sentences and still
    need to reach the user; they arrive in done rather than as tokens,
    and the client needs no special case for them.
