"""
WHAT:
    FastAPI dependency that extracts and verifies the JWT from the
    Authorization header, returning the verified user_id. Every
    protected route uses this - never trusts a user_id from the
    request body itself, per Phase 3.1's core rule.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    Centralizing this as ONE dependency means every route that needs
    identity gets it the same, safe way - impossible to accidentally
    add a new route that skips verification.

FLOW:
    FastAPI runs this automatically before the route function, on
    every request to a route that declares it as a dependency.

      - an unauthenticated flood costs one signature check and is
