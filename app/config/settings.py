"""
WHAT:
    This file defines the Settings class — the ONE place in the whole
    project that reads values from the .env file. Every other file that
    needs a secret (MongoDB URI, LLM API key, JWT secret) will import
    from here instead of reading environment variables directly.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    If every file read os.environ on its own, a typo in a variable name
    would fail silently deep inside some feature, maybe only when a real
    user hits that exact code path. By centralizing it into one class
    with required fields, the app instead fails LOUDLY and IMMEDIATELY
    at startup, naming exactly which value is missing or empty.

FLOW:
    1. App starts up.
    2. Something calls get_settings() for the first time.
    3. pydantic-settings reads the .env file and tries to fill in every
       field declared below.
    4. If a required field is missing or empty, this raises a clear
       error right here, before the app does anything else.
    5. If everything is present, get_settings() returns one Settings
       object that every other module can safely reuse.

LOGIC:
    A field is only accepted if it exists AND is not just blank/whitespace.
    Right now (Phase 1), all three values are intentionally still empty in
    .env — so running this file right now is EXPECTED to fail. That failure
    is proof the safety check works. We'll fill in real values as we reach
    Phase 2 (MongoDB), Phase 3 (JWT secret), and Phase 6 (LLM key).

MECHANISM:
    - BaseSettings (from pydantic-settings) automatically matches each
      field name to an environment variable of the same name, uppercased
      (e.g. field "mongodb_uri" reads the .env line "MONGODB_URI=...").
    - @field_validator adds our own extra rule: reject empty/whitespace
      values, since pydantic alone would accept an empty string as valid.
    - @lru_cache makes get_settings() build the Settings object only
      once, then reuse it — avoids re-reading the .env file on every call.
