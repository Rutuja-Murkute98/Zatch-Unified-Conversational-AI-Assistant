"""
WHAT:
    A per-user request limiter for /chat. Counts each user's requests
    over a rolling window and refuses further ones once they exceed the
    configured allowance. Shared across workers via Redis when one is
    configured, per-process otherwise.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    /chat is a public endpoint that spends real money on every call.
    Nothing currently stops one client - a retry loop, a leaked token, a
    buggy release of the mobile app - from issuing requests as fast as
    the network allows. On the free LLM tier that drains the shared
    quota in seconds, and EVERY other user then gets "I'm handling a lot
    of requests right now" until it resets.

    KEYED ON THE VERIFIED user_id, NOT ON IP. Mobile traffic arrives
    through carrier NAT, so thousands of unrelated users can share one
    address - an IP limit would throttle a whole network segment while
    still letting a single abusive account spread across addresses. The
    user_id comes from a signature-verified JWT (see security/auth.py),
    so it cannot be spoofed the way a header can.

WHY IT IS SHARED STATE, AND WHY THAT WAS A BUG:
    The counts used to live in a module-level dict, which is per-PROCESS.
    Under `uvicorn --workers 4` that is four independent limiters, each
    granting the full allowance, so the real limit was 4 x 20 and the
    configured number meant nothing. Worse, it was silently wrong: every
    test passes on one worker, and the gap only opens in the deployment
    where the limiter actually matters.

    Redis fixes it because a sliding window is exactly a sorted set -
    timestamps as scores, expired ones dropped by range, the count read
    back. Every worker reads and writes the same key, so the allowance
    is the allowance.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO:
    It bounds ONE user, not total load: twenty users each within their
    allowance can still exhaust the LLM quota between them, because that
    quota is per-service, not per-user. That case is already survivable
    - the orchestrator answers with FALLBACK_BUSY rather than failing -
    and fixing it properly means a global concurrency budget or a paid
    tier, not a bigger limiter. This closes the "one client burns it
    all" hole, which is the one an attacker or a bug actually reaches
    for.

FLOW:
    api/dependencies.py awaits this AFTER get_current_user_id, so the
    limiter always sees a verified identity. Unauthenticated requests
    never reach it - they are rejected earlier and cost nothing but a
    signature check.

LOGIC:
    A sliding window, not a fixed one. A fixed window resets on a clock
    boundary, which lets a client send a full allowance at 11:59:59 and
    another at 12:00:00 - double the intended rate, at the worst
    possible moment. Keeping the timestamps and expiring them
    individually costs a few bytes per request and has no such edge.

    WHEN REDIS IS UNREACHABLE the request is checked against the
    in-process table instead of being refused. Fail-open-to-per-process,
    not fail-closed: a cache outage would otherwise take the whole
    assistant down, and per-worker limiting is exactly what this file
    did before - degraded, not absent. Same reasoning the session store
    already applies to history.

MECHANISM:
    Redis path: one transaction per request against a sorted set -
    prune by score, add this request, read the count, read the oldest,
    refresh the TTL. If the count comes back over the allowance, the
    entry just added is removed again, so a REFUSED request never
    consumes a slot (otherwise a client hammering the endpoint pushes
    its own recovery further away - a lockout, not a limit).

    Adding first and compensating afterwards, rather than deciding first
    and adding after, is what makes the decision atomic without a Lua
    script: two concurrent requests can never both be told yes for the
    same free slot. The cost is that they can both be told no when only
    one should have been - over-strict during a burst, never
    over-permissive, which is the direction that matters here.

    Timestamps come from the APP's clock, not Redis TIME, so that the
    frozen-clock tests govern both backends identically. Worker clocks
    are NTP-synced in practice and a few milliseconds of skew is nothing
    against a 60-second window.

    In-process path: one deque of timestamps per user, oldest evicted on
    read. Same behaviour, one process wide.

    Rejections carry Retry-After either way, computed from when the
    oldest request in the window expires, so a client is told exactly
    how long to wait instead of guessing.
