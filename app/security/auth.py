"""
WHAT:
    This file verifies JWT tokens (the login tokens the Zatch mobile app
    already issues to logged-in users) and safely extracts the user's ID
    from them. It also includes a small TEST-ONLY helper to generate
    fake tokens locally, since we don't have the real signing secret yet.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    Per our Phase 3.1 design: the chat message text itself must NEVER be
    trusted for identity — only a cryptographically verified token proves
    who is really asking. This file is what actually enforces that rule
    in code. Every future API request (Phase 9) will pass its token
    through verify_token() before any feature logic runs.

FLOW:
    1. Mobile app sends a chat request with a JWT attached (Phase 9).
    2. Our API layer calls verify_token(token) before doing anything else.
    3. If the signature is invalid, expired, or malformed, this raises a
       clear error and the request is rejected immediately.
    4. If valid, it returns the user's ID, which then gets passed into
       every repository function (Phase 4) to scope that user's data.

LOGIC:
    A token is only accepted if ALL of these are true:
      - It was signed with our known secret/key, using the ONE algorithm
        we are configured to accept (proves it's genuine, not forged).
      - It carries an expiry, and has not passed it (a token with no
        expiry would be a permanent key if it ever leaked).
      - It matches the expected audience and issuer, when those are
        configured.
      - It actually contains a user ID claim we can extract.

    THE OPEN QUESTION, AND HOW IT IS HANDLED. We still do not know what
    the real Zatch backend calls its user-ID claim, or which algorithm
    it signs with. Both used to be hardcoded guesses in this file, which
    meant being wrong about either required a code change. They are now
    SETTINGS (JWT_ALGORITHM, JWT_USER_ID_CLAIMS) with the guesses as
    defaults, so the answer lands in .env instead.

    Until it does, verify_token tries several plausible claim names in
    priority order and LOGS which one matched - so the first real token
    to reach this service answers the question in the logs rather than
    simply being rejected.

MECHANISM:
    - PyJWT's jwt.encode() creates a signed token (our TEST-ONLY helper
      uses this to simulate what the real backend does).
    - jwt.decode() verifies the signature and expiry automatically,
      raising specific exception types we catch and translate into
      clear, predictable errors for the rest of our app to handle.

    token is rejected as "valid but has no user". Trying several in a
    fixed priority order makes the service work on first contact with a
    real token instead of failing until someone edits code.

    THIS IS NOT A SECURITY SHORTCUT. It runs only AFTER the signature
    has been verified, so every claim read here was written by the
    backend that holds the signing key - not by the caller. The choice
    is about which trusted field to read, not whether to trust it.
