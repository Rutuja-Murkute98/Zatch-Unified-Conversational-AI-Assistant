"""
WHAT:
    All bargaining-related data lookups from PDF §5 (eligibility, status,
    counter-offer, suggested amount). §5.1 ("what is bargaining") is
    static FAQ text with no database involved, so it belongs in Phase
    5's feature layer, not here.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    check_bargain_eligibility() and suggest_offer_amount() are NOT
    scoped to a user — they're properties of the PRODUCT (anyone can
    ask "can I bargain on this?" before ever making an offer). But
    get_bargain_status() and get_counter_offer() ARE scoped by buyerId,
    same cross-user protection pattern as orders_repo, since those
    reveal a specific negotiation between one buyer and one seller.

FLOW:
    Called by Phase 5's feature logic and, later, Phase 7's tool-calling
    layer.

LOGIC:
    get_bargain_status()/get_counter_offer() accept EITHER a specific
    bargain_id OR a product_id (returning the user's most recent bargain
    on that product) — matching how a real user actually refers to a
    bargain in chat ("my offer on the blue jacket"), since they'd never
    know or type a raw bargain ID.
    suggest_offer_amount() uses bargainSettings.maximumDiscount and
    products.price per the PDF's own stated data source for §5.5.

MECHANISM:
    Same two-layer safety pattern as every other repo: Step 3.3
    allowlist as the MongoDB projection, Step 3.4 sanitizer on every
    result, for both `bargains` and `products` documents fetched here.
