"""
WHAT:
    All 7 product-related data lookups from PDF §4 (Product Discovery).
    This is the ONLY file in the whole app allowed to query the
    `products` collection directly. By agreed design (unlike orders),
    two functions here (get_recommendations, get_seller_info) also read
    from `users` directly, since products aren't owned by one user the
    way orders are, and splitting those two into a separate not-yet-built
    users_repo would leave PDF §4.6/§4.7 unfinished for no real benefit
    right now.

WHY THIS APPROACH:
    Unlike orders, products are public — any user can browse any
    product, so there's no per-user scoping/cross-user test here. The
    interesting design work is instead in accepting ALREADY-STRUCTURED
    filters (category, price range, color, size) rather than raw text —
    turning natural language like "shirts under 500" into these filters
    is Phase 6/7's job (the LLM), once it exists. This repo function
    just needs to query correctly once it receives clean filter values.

FLOW:
    Called by Phase 5's feature logic and, later, Phase 7's tool-calling
    layer, which will have already extracted structured filters from
    the user's natural-language message via the LLM.

LOGIC:
    - search_products() and get_trending_products() both exclude
      isSold=True products by default (ASSUMPTION — flagged for
      confirmation: showing a sold-out item in general browsing/trending
      would be a bad experience; direct lookups below do NOT apply this
      filter, since a direct question about a specific product should
      always get an answer even if it's sold).
    - Category/subCategory matching is case-insensitive (NL extraction
      might produce "men" vs "Men" — we shouldn't lose a match over
      casing).
    - Price filtering uses discountedPrice, matching the PDF §4.2
      example exactly ("products under 500" -> discountedPrice <= 500).

MECHANISM:
    Same two-layer safety pattern as orders_repo: every query uses the
    Step 3.3 allowlist as its MongoDB projection, and every result
    passes through the Step 3.4 sanitizer before returning — for BOTH
    `products` and `users` documents fetched in this file.
