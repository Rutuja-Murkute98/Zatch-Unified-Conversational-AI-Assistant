# Zatch conversational assistant.
#
# WHY TWO STAGES: the builder needs uv and a compiler cache to resolve
# and install dependencies; the thing that actually runs needs neither.
# Shipping them means shipping a package manager, its cache and a build
# toolchain into production, which is both larger and more to attack.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE:
#   .env       Configuration arrives as environment variables at run
#              time. Baking secrets into a layer puts a live MongoDB URI
#              and a JWT signing secret into every copy of the image,
#              including any registry it is pushed to, permanently -
#              layers are not removed by deleting the file later.
#   scripts/   Dev-only by the project's own definition, and two of them
#              WRITE (seed_demo_data.py, import_real_catalogue.py). A
#              read-only service should not carry tools that are not.
#              Run diagnostics from a checkout against the same .env.
#   tests/     Excluded via .dockerignore; they need a live sandbox and
#              have no business in a runtime image.

# uv writes the venv at $WORKDIR/.venv, and every console script in it
# gets an absolute shebang pointing back at that interpreter. Built in
# /build and copied to /app, `uvicorn` starts with
# `#!/build/.venv/bin/python` - a path that does not exist in the
# runtime stage. The container then dies with "uvicorn: not found",
# which reads like a missing dependency and is nothing of the sort.
#
# Building at the final path makes the shebangs correct by construction.
WORKDIR /app

# Dependencies before source, so editing app/ does not re-resolve and
# re-download every package - the layer cache holds as long as
# pyproject.toml and uv.lock are unchanged.

# --frozen, NOT `uv sync` alone: the lockfile is the record of what was
# tested. Letting the build re-resolve means the image can quietly ship
# a different dependency tree than the suite ran against, and the first
# anyone hears of it is in production.
