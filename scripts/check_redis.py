"""
Checks whether conversation memory is actually backed by Redis, and
proves it with a real write/read round trip.

    uv run python scripts/check_redis.py

Prints a diagnosis rather than a stack trace: the common failures here
(no URL, the Upstash REST URL pasted by mistake, a wrong password, TLS)
all look similar from the driver and different from each other in what
you have to do about them.

    The query string matters here. A URI like

        mongodb+srv://u:p@cluster0.example.net?appName=Zatch-Semantic-Search

    has no slash before "?", so splitting on "/" alone leaves the appName
    glued to the host - and a guard looking for the staging cluster's name
    then matched a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cluster whose appName happened to
    mention it. The guard refused a legitimate destination and blamed the
    user. Strip "?" as well as "/".

    THE SCHEME MUST GO FIRST, and used not to. Splitting on "@" only
    removes credentials when there ARE credentials; "redis://localhost:6379"
    has none, so the first "/" reached belonged to "://" and the host came
    back as "redis:". Every credential-less URI reported its own scheme as
    its hostname - which made the local-Redis branch below unreachable and
    printed an Upstash TLS warning about localhost.
