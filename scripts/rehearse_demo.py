"""
Runs the client demo end to end, records what the assistant ACTUALLY
says, and writes it to docs/demo-script.md as a run sheet.

    uv run python scripts/rehearse_demo.py

WHY:
    "Hope it works live" is not a plan. This runs every question in
    order against the demo database, captures the real reply and the
    real token cost, and fails loudly if any answer comes back as a
    fallback - so the script you take into the meeting is one you have
    already seen work.

    Token cost is measured because it is the binding constraint: Groq's
    free tier allows 8,000 prompt tokens per MINUTE, shared across
    everyone. The summary at the end says whether the demo fits.

PACING:
    A real client fires questions quickly; the free tier cannot. Each
    question waits PAUSE_SECONDS so the rehearsal reflects a paced demo
    rather than measuring the rate limiter. On a paid key, set
    PAUSE_SECONDS=0.
