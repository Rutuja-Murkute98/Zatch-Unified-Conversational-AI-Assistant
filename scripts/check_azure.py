"""
Verifies the Azure OpenAI setup end to end, and reports which of the
four values is wrong when it is not working.

    uv run python scripts/check_azure.py

WHY THIS EXISTS:
    Azure needs FOUR values that must all agree, and each one fails
    differently and misleadingly:

      endpoint     wrong host -> DNS error, looks like no internet
      api key      wrong -> 401, looks like the resource is missing
      deployment   wrong -> 404 that reads "model not found", when the
                   model is fine and only the DEPLOYMENT name is wrong
      api version  wrong -> 400 about an unsupported parameter, which
                   looks like a bug in our request

    The deployment one is the trap: the deployment name is chosen by
    whoever created it and need NOT match the model name, so a 404
    saying "gpt-5-mini not found" can appear while gpt-5-mini is
    deployed perfectly well under a different name.

    So this makes a real tool-calling request - not a ping - because
    tool calling is what the assistant actually does, and a model that
    answers plain chat but mishandles 32 tool schemas would pass a
    simpler check and fail in the demo.
