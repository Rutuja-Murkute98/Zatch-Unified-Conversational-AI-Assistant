"""
Warms the LLM prompt cache before a demo, and proves it worked.

    uv run python scripts/warm_cache.py

WHY:
    Groq and Azure both cache prompt prefixes automatically - 50% off
    cached tokens on Groq,
    and cached tokens do not count toward the rate limit. But the cache
    expires after 2 hours of disuse, so the FIRST question after an idle
    period pays full price and is visibly slower.

    That first question is the one the client sees. This sends a throwaway
    request carrying the exact same prefix the demo will use, so the real
    first question lands on a warm cache.

HOW IT PROVES IT:
    The usage payload does not expose cache hits, so asserting "warmed"
    would be a claim, not a measurement. Instead it sends the prefix
    TWICE and reports Groq's `prompt_time`. A cold prefix takes several
    times longer to process than a cached one; the drop between call one
    and call two is the cache engaging, observed rather than assumed.

WHAT MAKES THIS CORRECT:
    Caching is a PREFIX match, so a warm-up only helps if it sends the
    byte-identical prefix. This builds the system prompt through the same
    build_system_prompt() the orchestrator uses and sends the same TOOLS
    list - it does not approximate either. tool_choice="none" keeps it to
    a single cheap round with no tool execution.
