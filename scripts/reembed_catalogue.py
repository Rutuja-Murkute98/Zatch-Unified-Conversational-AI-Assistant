"""
Re-embeds a product catalogue with Azure text-embedding-3-small, and
rebuilds the Atlas vector index to match.

    uv run python scripts/reembed_catalogue.py "<WRITABLE_URI>" <database>
    uv run python scripts/reembed_catalogue.py "<WRITABLE_URI>" <database> --apply

WHY:
    The existing product_embeddings were produced by a model nothing
    records - 384 dimensions, unit-normalised, otherwise unidentified.
    find_similar_products works around that by using a STORED vector as
    the query, which needs no model. Free-text search cannot: "something
    cosy for winter" has to be embedded, and embedding it with the wrong
    model returns ranked nonsense that looks like a working search.

    Re-embedding with a known model removes the unknown. Every vector is
    then one you produced, with a tag saying so.

    Cost is not a factor at this size: 143 products is roughly 14,000
    tokens, about $0.0003 at text-embedding-3-small's $0.02/M.

*** READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING IT ON A LIVE DATABASE ***

    Zatch's own pipeline watches products via a change stream and
    re-embeds them with the OLD model. If it is still running when this
    finishes, the first product anyone edits gets a 384-dim vector
    written back into a 1536-dim collection - and the index will reject
    it or the search will silently skip it.

    So on a live database this is a MIGRATION, not a script: stop or
    update that pipeline first. Against the demo database, none of that
    applies.

SAFETY:
    Dry run unless --apply. Refuses the real cluster unless
    --i-have-stopped-the-sync-pipeline is also passed, which is
    deliberately awkward to type.
