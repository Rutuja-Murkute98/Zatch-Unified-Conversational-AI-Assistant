"""
Builds the demo question list FROM the connected database.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
    The rehearsal originally hardcoded questions written against the demo
    dataset - "ZTC000301", "DEMO10", "the buddha". Pointed at the real
    database those identifiers do not exist, so the assistant correctly
    answered "not found" ten times and the rehearsal reported success,
    because its only check was "no fallback message".

    A perfectly-formed reply about data that is not there is not a pass.
    Worse, it silently broke the closer: the other-buyer's-order question
    returned "couldn't find" because the ID was fictional, not because
    scoping blocked it - so the strongest moment in the demo was proving
    nothing at all.

    Everything here is therefore looked up first. The questions name real
    orders, real products and real coupons from whichever database is
    configured, and each step carries an EXPECTATION so a "not found"
    answer fails instead of passing.

CHOOSING THE BUYER:
    Not the first one found. A buyer with orders but no cart and no
    bargain would make three questions unanswerable through no fault of
    the assistant, so candidates are scored on how much of the demo they
    can actually support and the best one wins.
